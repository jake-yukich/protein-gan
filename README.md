Implementation of "Generative Modeling for Protein Structures" (NeurIPS 2018), the first research paper on generative AI for protein design. I've found this paper particularly interesting for its use of a convex optimization algorithm to recover structure predictions, the math behind which has been a lot of fun to explore.
